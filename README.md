# Scrape all Oscar acceptance speeches 

This notebook was prepared for our Text Mining course at BSE. It includes the script to download all the Oscar speeches from the official website. 
As an additional feature a "category search" option was also added, which allows the user to search for specific film categories' Oscar speeches.
Moreover, the user can also filter for different years.
